Assignment Overview:



Technical Impression:

-Explain any Static methods
	-getColor(), CHOSER is static so it makes sense
-Explain enum 
-Explain propertyChangeListener on Actions.
-ColorAction's createGraphics is useless maybe I need to restructure the hierarchy
-when doing Pencil, and the troubles i had with it, i realized that when repaint was called all if my shapes were being redrawn unessisarily, so i added a boolean 

-It got a little convoluted at the end, with a ton of propertyChange events and such
